I'm starting this notes section because:
<ul>
<li>I should write more</li>
<li>So that I remember what I've done</li>
<li>To push me to make good explanations, interpretations, and abstractions. At a minimum, the process of coming up with these should be helpful as a form of "rubber ducking".</li>
</ul>
<br>
That said, this is not a blog -- it is a "notes section". Don't expect the same level of polish you'd find on a blog; no html templates, no kerekt spelling, <b>just the essentials</b>. Maybe I'll clean it up later, but for now, this is nothing more than the html-equivalent of notes casually written on a napkin (a napkin full of pizza grease).
<br><br>
Alright, let's get started!
