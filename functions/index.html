## Relations, Functions
A relation is a pairing between sets. 
<center>

|   X   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |   Y   |
|:------|:-----:|--------:|
| 1 || -2 |
| 2 || 5 |
| 3 || 13 |
| 4 || 13 |
| 5 || 15 |

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Example: a relation represented as a table.</span>
</center>

A function is a type of relation where every element in one set (the domain) is mapped to exactly one element in another (the range).
There are a few special types of functions,
- **injective**, or one-to-one, functions map every X to a unique Y. The X and Y columns don't repeat.
- **surjective**, or onto, functions map every Y from some X. Every X and Y appear in the table (though Y's may repeat).
- **bijective** functions are injective and surjective, ie every X is mapped to a unique Y, and every Y corresonds to a unique X. Every X and Y appears in the table, and the X and Y columns don't repeat.

### The inverses
An inverse reverses or "undoes" a function f: X→Y. 

With respect to f, a function g: Y→X is a
- **left inverse** if (g∘f)(x) = x, ∀x.
- **right inverse** if (f∘g)(y) = y, ∀y.

A function that has both a left and right inverse has one unique inverse.
This is easy to show; let a and b be any left and right inverses of a function f, then
<center>
b = identity∘b = a∘f∘b = a∘identity = a
</center>

*Injective functions have a left inverse* -
Because each x∈X is associated with a distinct y∈Y, we can go back to x from y.
Given y, pick the only x that's associated with y.
However if the function is injective but not surjective, the left inverse will be a partial function because the range of the function, and thus domain of the inverse, will be a subset of Y.

*Surjective functions have a right inverse* -
Because every y∈Y is associated with some x∈X, we can go to any y from some x.
Given y, pick an x that's associated with y.


*Bijective functions have a unique left and right inverse* -
Because bijections are injective and surjective, they have both a left and a right inverse, and thus a single inverse.

A few other properties:
- The inverse of a bijection is a bijection
- Composition of bijections is a bijection
- There can only be a bijection between two finite sets if they are the same size
- A bijection of a space could be presented as a different representation of the same space - one can always switch back and forth.

Some examples of bijections:
- Change of coordinates
- Rotations
- Permutations
- Identity function
- Mapping from (0,1)→ℝ, eg <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ln(1%2Fx+-+1)">ln(1/x - 1)</a>
- Mapping from a line to a circle

## A silly example: talking through a tuba

</center>
Could a tuba be a function? Sure, you put in a sound, another sound comes out. 
Lets say you speak plain english into a tuba.

If each input sound produces a distinct tuba sound, it's injective, so its left-invertible and we can reconstruct speach from the tuba.
The pipeline would be: 
<center>
speach → tuba → left-inverse → speach.
</center>

If a tuba could make any sound, our tuba would be surjective. 
Then we could find a right-inverse that could make a tuba say anything. 
The pipeline would be:
<center>
speach → right-inverse → tuba → speach.
</center>

Although I've never touched a tuba, they seem plausibly injective.
Reconstructing speech by approximating a tuba's left-inverse sounds like fun -- I just need the data!
Unfortunately, I don't think tubas are surjective, because they seem to only be capable of making fart sounds.

### Relations that are not functions
If a relation has an input paired with multiple outputs, it is not a "true" function.

For example, the following relation is not a function,
<center>
	![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Multivalued_function.svg/400px-Multivalued_function.svg.png)
</center>
What if we related each input to a set containing multiple outputs? This relation is a special kind of function known as a multivalued function.
Applying this to the above example, we could draw a relation between elements in X and sets of elements in Y:
<center>

|   X   | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |   Y   |
|:------|:-----:|--------:|
| 1 || {a} |
| 2 || {d} |
| 3 || {b, c} |

</center>

The inverse of a non-injective function can now be represented as a multivalued function.


### Mixture models
We can also design a function that emits a random variable, or parameters to a random variable.
This kind of function allows us to emit a probability distribution over events.
A mixture model is a statistical model that predicts a random variable as a weighted sum of components, such as gaussians, as shown below,

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Example: (gaussian) mixture model</span>
</center>

These kinds of models are exceptionally helpful for problems where many outputs should be associated with a single input; when there are many right answers.
Consider the problem of predicting where someone will walk.
A mixture model could give us multiple trajectories, each with an associated probability. 
On the other hand, a conventional model would just give us a point estimate, ie a single trajectory.
If the conventional model used MSE, it should predict the (weighted) average of multiple trajectories,
and if this problem were a martingale, it'd predict they'd stand still.
