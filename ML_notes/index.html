I'm starting this notes section because:
- I should write more
- So that I remember what I've done
- To push me to make good explanations, interpretations, and abstractions. At a minimum, the process of coming up with these should be helpful as a form of "rubber ducking".

That said, this is not a blog -- it is a "notes section". Don't expect the same level of polish you'd find on a blog; no fancy templates, no kerekt spelling, *just the essentials*. Maybe I'll clean it up later, but for now, this is nothing more than the html-equivalent of a napkin.

Alright, let's get started!

- <a href='functions'>Functions, tubas, and mixture models</a>
