Some webpages I'd like to share with you:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><a href='/viz_sandbox'>Viz Sandbox</a> - this was a homework asignment that I later found useful.</li>
	<li><a href='/emojirithmetic'>Emojirithmetic</a> - an interactive demo of emoji embedding arithmetic, with embeddings taken from the <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08359'>emoji2vec paper</a>.</li>
</ul>
