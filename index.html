Webpages I'd like to share with you:
- <a href='ML_notes/index.html'>Notes on Machine Learning</a>


- Visualization
	- <a href='viz_sandbox'>Viz Sandbox</a> - a sandbox for interactive visualization.
	- <a href='recipes'>Recipe Explorer</a> - fun, very experimental, (interactive) visualizations of recipes I made for a final project.
	
- For fun!
	- <a href='poster_grid'>Posters</a> I once put up all over my office. Could be helpful in explaining random number generators (and their faults).
	- <a href='pintograph'>Pintograph</a> - An interactive simulation of a (modified) pintograph machine I made for an art project with my twin.  The interaction made parametric design a lot more fun, and allowed us to explore the vast space of parameters without any arduous typing.  In the end, we made 3D prints of the designs, laser engravings, and even a metal casting.
	- <a href='emojirithmetic'>Emojirithmetic</a> - an interactive demo of emoji embedding arithmetic, with embeddings taken from the <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08359'>emoji2vec paper</a>.
