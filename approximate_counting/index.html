# Approximate Counting
</center>
Approximate counting is a randomized method for counting with minimal space.
Traditional counting has us increment a counter every increment, 
requiring \\( \log\_2(n+1) \\) bits to count to a number \\( n \\).
For example, counting to [a googol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol) 
requires \\(\lceil log\_2(10^{100} + 1)\rceil = 333\\) bits.
Approximate counting effectively let's us choose how many bits we want to use,
for example we'll show how to count to googol using 
only \\( \lceil \log\_2(\log\_{10}(n)+1) \rceil = 7 \\) bits.

Alas, approximate counting isn't exact, and we end up trading off the saved bits for accuracy.
For that reason, it's really only useful for data so large that even \\( log\_2(n) \\) bits is prohibitive.
However, in this post we'll see that in expectation this gives the correct count (ie is unbiased),
and that through amplification the variance can be made small.
We'll also go over and compare a bunch of different ways to do approximate counting.

## How it works
Approximate counting uses a counter to estimate the actual count.
Given a counter value of \\( c \\), we'll say the estimated count will be \\( f(c) \\), 
where \\( f: \mathbb{Z}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+ \\) is monotonically increasing.
At each INCREMENT operation, we will increment the counter with probability
\begin{align}
P(\text{increment} | c) = \frac{1}{f(c+1) - f(c)}
\end{align}
The construction of this algorithm is so elegant and simple.
Regardless of our \\( f \\), we expect \\(f(c+1) - f(c)\\) INCREMENT operations 
will increase our estimate by  \\(f(c+1) - f(c)\\).
Lets go over an example to get a better feel for how this works, ...

### An Example
Let's take an example with \\( f(c) = 10^x \\).
Then we get \\( f(0), f(1), f(2),... \\) to be \\( 1,10,100,1000... \\), 
and the probability of incrementing our counter at each stage 
\\(P(\text{increment} | 0), P(\text{increment} | 1), ... \\)
will then be \\( 1/9, 1/99, 1/999, ... \\).
The number of INCREMENTs need to increment our counter follows a geometric distribution.
In expectation, we'll need \\( 9 \\) INCREMENT operations 
to get from \\( c=0 \\) to \\( c=1 \\), 
\\( 99 \\) INCREMENTs to get from \\( c=1 \\) to \\( c=2 \\), and so forth.

To count to googol, or 1e100, our counter needs to reach 100, 
which takes just \\( \lceil \log\_2(100+1) \rceil = 7 \\) bits.

### Proving the expectation is unbiased
Each time we call INCREMENT, we expect the estimate to increase by 1,
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[\text{increase} | c] &= P(\text{increase} | c) (f(c+1) - f(c)) \\\\
&= \frac{1}{f(c+1) - f(c)} (f(c+1) - f(c)) \\\\
&= 1
\end{align}
By linearity of expectation, after \\( n \\) INCREMENT operations, 
the expected estimate will increase by \\( n \\).

### Deriving the variance
It's difficult to derive variance for all functions, so let's focus on two classes of functions,
linear and exponential functions.

#### Linear functions
First, for a linear function \\( f(x) = ax+b \\), we have
\begin{align}
\text{Var}\_c[ac + b] &= \text{Var}\Big[\sum\_{c=0}^n P(c)(ac + b)\Big] \\\\
&= \text{Var}\Big[ a \Big(\sum\_{c=0}^n P(c)\Big) + b \Big] \\\\
&= a^2 \text{Var}\Big[\sum\_{c=0}^n P(c) \Big] \\\\
&= a^2 \text{Var}\Big[B(n, 1/a) \Big] && \text{forms binomial distribution with } P(\text{increment}) = 1/a \\\\
&= a^2 \big( n\frac{1}{a}\frac{a-1}{a} \big) \\\\
&= n(a-1)
\end{align}

Which is really not very good;
we're saving a constant \\( \lceil \log\_2(a) \rceil \\) bits at the expense of 
introducing linear \\(n(a-1)\\) variance.

#### Exponential functions
For an exponential function \\( f(x) = ab^x + k \\),
TODO: writeup proof
\begin{align}
\text{Var}\_c[ab^c+k] &= a^2(b-1){n \choose 2}
\end{align}
Which is better; we're only using \\( \lceil \log\_2(\log\_b(n) - \log\_b(a)) \rceil \\) bits 
and introducing \\(\Theta(a^2bn^2) \\) variance.

Based on these results, it makes most sense to set \\(a=1\\).
In Morris's algorithm the function is defined as 
\\(f(x)=2^x-1 \\) for it's convenient numerical and computational properties.


### Reducing variance by amplification
Like with many randomized algorithms, we can improve our estimates by amplification,
a process where we run an algorithm multiple times to get a result.
In this case, we'll have multiple counters and do something like take 
the mean or median of those counter's estimates.

The key to amplification is figuring out how to combine the results, 
and then how many results we need to guarantee a certain variance or performance ratio.
Instead of deriving how many counters we need to get some variance \\(\sigma \\),
I'll keep things simple and just include it as a slider :)

We can use either the mean or median to aggregate the counters' estimates.
Asymptotically, the sample median has better convergence properties, 
with variance \\( \sigma\_{\text{median}} = \Theta(\frac{\sigma}{n}) \\), 
where \\(n\\) is the number of counters.
The mean has variance of \\( \sigma\_{\text{mean}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \\),
so if we have many counters, and likely large counts, we would care about asymptotics and prefer the median.

However the sample median also has its downsides.
Unlike the mean, the median fluctuates a lot, you'll notice that it jumps around erratically.
Second, the median can only take the form of \\(f(\mathbb{Z})\\).
For example with \\(f(x) = 2^x\\), the median can only be a power of 2,
which bounds the mean accuracy of the estimate,
whereas the mean of powers of 2 can be any number (with sufficient n).
