	Julian grew up to be a normal human boy.
	<br>
	He was known to do normal human things like:
	<ul>
		<li>Eat food at <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/">McDonald's</a></li>
		<li>Walk around</li>
		<li>Laugh at dogs</li>
	</ul>
	One day after school, Julian's parents made him come home for a family dinner.
	<br>
	For dinner, they prepared the usual: a single fly encased in spider-butt-silk.
	<br><br>
	Julian said:
	<p class="julians-quote">
		"I cannot eat this. Not only do I not enjoy eating these bugs, but a single fly does not contain enough nutrients to sustain a human such as myself."
	</p>
	After a heated argument with his parents, Julian did the unthinkable: he squashed them. In his words: <br>
	<p class="julians-quote">"What started as a frustrated stomp became a double spider murder. <br>This is one of the most regretful steps I've taken."</p>
	For many years, Julian spent his time lamenting the squashing of his parents. He even tried turning himself in, but the police said that murdering your parents is not a crime if your parents are small insects.
	<br><br>
	Julian spent the remainder of his highschool and college years grieving, advocating for spiders, and programming. Some notable qoutes of his are displayed below:
	<ul>
		<li>If only I hadn't squashed my parents, I'd have a loving family. How I wish I could go back; how I wish I could have put them in a tissue and thrown them outside. <b>I would do anything to go back.</b></li>
		<li>Spiders are your friends. They stay out of your way. They kill and eat the bad bugs, like mosquitos and dirty house flies. And they will love you dearly if you give them the chance. And what do they ask in return? Nothing but a quiet place in your house.</li>
		<li>LISP will give you magic functional programming powers.</li>
	</ul>

	Fastforward to 2018: Trump declares war on spiders.
	<br>
	Although experts agree that spiders play a crucial role in the ecosystem, and are generally awesome, Trump argues that spiders are icky and have too many legs to be trusted with. Trump's statement is shown below:<br>

	After much publicized spider advocacy, Julian officialy takes sides in the epic war between the United States and All Spiders (and Julian).
	<br>
	Unfortunately, immediately upon announcing his allegiance to spiders, the SWAT team entered Julian's house in Queens, NY and switfly ended his life.

	Candidly, Julian had no chance: the United State's Army vs. Julian and the spiders was a landslide.
	<br>
	After the tragic loss, Julian was remembered internationally, by all spiders, as a martyr and a hero.

	2 weeks after his death, Julian miracolously rose from the dead. He rose from the dead as a spider demi-god.
	<br>
	Currently, Julian is a senior year student studying Computer Science and Math at Hampshire College.
	<br>
	He is also a demi-god, religious leader, fashion icon, president, and cultural influencer for spiders worldwide. In his free time, he likes to teach, read, and code.
