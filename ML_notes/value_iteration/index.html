Above you're seeing a <a href="http://artint.info/html/ArtInt_227.html">Value Iteration</a> algorithm solve a maze/"Grid World" problem. 
The color of each cell represents the payoff it provides. 
The explorer is rewarded for green cells and punished for red cells, the darker the color, the stronger the payoff. 
You'll also see arrows that indicate the explorer's "policy", which is the decision it makes in each cell.

Value Iteration, and other Reinforcement Learning algorithms, are intended to solve non-deterministic problems that fall under the framework of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process">MDPs</a> (Markov decision processes).
However, for the sake of simplicity, I made the problem *deterministic* (not random), meaning that an action in a cell will always lead to the same result.
This really isn't an issue because deterministic problems are just a special case of a non-deterministic problems, where each probability is either 0% or 100%.

One of my goals was to visualize how the expected rewards propagate, or flow, through the model. 
With enough slider-sliding, you should be able to observe that the policy *cascades*. 
Hailing from NYC, it kinda reminds me of a chain reaction you'd see in a large crowd, as if something valuable (or repulsive) was discovered. 
I wanted to show an analogy here, but I couldn't find any satisfying gifs of crowd simulations or ant colonies.
